Article qui commence par une super anecdote de la sagesse d'un professeur…

« Thought incarnates into a network, and not only because Roam notes are cloud-based, easy to share and collaborate on: You realize that just by thinking the way you already do, and by taking note of what you think, you are building something. Roam accentuates that realization with a visual map of connections. »
« After the initial spontaneous growth of topic hubs, you have to start memorizing your own taxonomies to make sure future notes will tie into past networks. You might begin to wish you _did_ have more hierarchy and forethought before various words and phrases became ossified in your index. »
«  the sense of ease that excites new users is deceptive.) »
« Seeing the shape of your ideas is not the same as having new ideas. Creating a too-comprehensive portrait of your own thoughts can amount to locking yourself into a labyrinth of your own preconceptions »
« the arduous process of flipping through his cards for each new project was the secret source of his vast knowledge, and that by making the process so easy for myself I had sacrificed its primary benefit. »
« Instead my notes were beginning to depress me. They were a visible testament of fruitless effort. « 

PAS DE FRICTION et c'est bien ça le problème !!

Super intéressant : il a lu un bouquin de Nikla Luhmann et il a pas aimé du tout ! il dit que c'est un assemblage de trucs sympa, mais sans trop de fondement on va dire
